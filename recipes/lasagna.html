    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Meat sauce</li>
        <li>Béchamel Sauce</li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup ricotta cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Prepare the Meat Sauce:</b>
            Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add chopped onion and sauté until translucent. Stir in garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add ground beef or sausage and cook until browned. Drain excess fat. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Simmer for 20–30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Make the Béchamel Sauce:</b>
            In a medium saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Whisk in flour and cook for 1–2 minutes until lightly golden. Gradually whisk in warm milk, ensuring no lumps form. Cook, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens. Season with nutmeg, salt, and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Assemble the Lasagna:</b>
            Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Spread a thin layer of meat sauce at the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Lay 3 lasagna noodles over the sauce. Add a layer of béchamel sauce, meat sauce, mozzarella, ricotta (if using), and Parmesan. Repeat the layers, ending with a generous topping of béchamel and cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Bake:</b>
            Cover the dish with aluminum foil (to prevent the cheese from browning too quickly) and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15–20 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Serve:</b>
            Allow the lasagna to rest for 10–15 minutes before slicing to ensure clean layers. Serve warm and enjoy!
